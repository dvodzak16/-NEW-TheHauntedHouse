Its Halloween, and you&apos;re out trick-or-treating with your parents. Its almost midnight, and you have arrived at this spooky-looking house. You look for your parents, but they seem to have run into a friend. You&apos;ll only take a second. You open the large iron gate and enter the front yard, and as you enter, the gate slams behind you! Trapped, your parents can&apos;t seem to hear you; you have to find a way out!

Main Room
Upon entering, you can clearly see that this is the biggest room in the house. The house itself has a cliche haunted house look, but you aren&apos;t certain if its for show or for real...A chandelier hangs delicately from the ceiling, giving the room eerie light. There is a piano in the corner. There are two potted plants on either sides of the stairs. There are stairs to the north. The Family Room is to the west. The Library is to the east.

The room is dank, and it doesn&apos;t smell too good here either. There is armor for a knight, modeled on the left side of the hallway. There is a painting hanging on the right wall here. There is a boy here huddled on the side of the hallway. The stairs are to the south, and the hallway continues to the north.

You peer into the room to find it empty.

Upon entering the library, you are immediately amazed. Shelves line the walls, and hundreds of thick books seemed to be packed within the spaces. There is a blue book on the ground, near the window on the east side of the room. There is also a red book sticking out in one of the shelves. There is a long carpet in the room, leading from the doorway to the window. The main room is to the west.

Library
Upon entering the library, you are immediately amazed. Shelves line the walls, and hundreds of thick books seemed to be packed within the spaces. There is a blue book on the ground, near the window on the east side of the room. There is also a red book sticking out in one of the shelves. There is a long carpet in the room, leading from the doorway to the window. The main room is to the west.

Library
Upon entering the library, you are immediately amazed. Shelves line the walls, and hundreds of thick books seemed to be packed within the spaces. There is a blue book on the ground, near the window on the east side of the room. There is also a red book sticking out in one of the shelves. There is a long carpet in the room, leading from the doorway to the window. The main room is to the west.

Upon entering the library, you are immediately amazed. Shelves line the walls, and hundreds of thick books seemed to be packed within the spaces. There is a blue book on the ground, near the window on the east side of the room. There is also a red book sticking out in one of the shelves. There is a long carpet in the room, leading from the doorway to the window. The main room is to the west.

Main Room
Upon entering, you can clearly see that this is the biggest room in the house. The house itself has a cliche haunted house look, but you aren&apos;t certain if its for show or for real...A chandelier hangs delicately from the ceiling, giving the room eerie light. There is a piano in the corner. There are two potted plants on either sides of the stairs. There are stairs to the north. The Family Room is to the west. The Library is to the east.

The room is dim, even with the flashlight on. You can&apos;t see much. There is a lamp in the northwest corner, a chair in the southwest corner, and a TV in the northeast corner. A rug is in the center of the room, and a painting hangs on the south wall. The main room is to the east.

You can see a flashlight (providing light) here.

She talks about scaring away kids from her property, and how its enjoyable to cause trouble with a little magic. She also mentions turning a kid into a plastic horse because she knew the certain word to unlock her iron gate. You close the book, you felt dizzy from all the reading.

You call for the boy inside, who bursts out of the front door in seconds. The girl closes her eyes and mutters a phrase under he breath, and the iron gate swings open. The three of you sprint out of the gate and into the street. Panting, you look up to find that both the boy and the girl had disappeared...strange, you were going to thank them. You run back to your parents, they must be worried sick about you! You arrive, and to your surprise, nothing much has changed, as if only a couple seconds had passed by. You were about to tell your parents about the house, when you turned around, and it wasn&apos;t there. An empty lot with a lonesome tree in it stood in its place. You thought you heard a cackle in the distance. ***

Long Hallway
The room is dank, and it doesn&apos;t smell too good here either. There is armor for a knight, modeled on the left side of the hallway. There is a painting hanging on the right wall here. There is a boy here huddled on the side of the hallway. The stairs are to the south, and the hallway continues to the north.

You call for the boy inside, who bursts out of the front door in seconds. The girl closes her eyes and mutters a phrase under he breath, and the iron gate swings open. The three of you sprint out of the gate and into the street. Panting, you look up to find that both the boy and the girl had disappeared...strange, you were going to thank them. You run back to your parents, they must be worried sick about you! You arrive, and to your surprise, nothing much has changed, as if only a couple seconds had passed by. You were about to tell your parents about the house, when you turned around, and it wasn&apos;t there. An empty lot with a lonesome tree in it stood in its place. You thought you heard a cackle in the distance. ***
