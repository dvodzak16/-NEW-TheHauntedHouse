How well does the game accomplish what you set out to do?
When I set out to do this game, I didn’t have one set idea, I was pretty open about new ideas and concepts that I could add later to the game. But, I did have a general outline of what I wanted to happen within my game, and I think comparing my final project with that outline, I cam pretty close to accomplishing what I wanted.
Discuss a time when you got stuck, and how you got unstuck.
I don’t remember getting stuck too often, just because I had a bunch resources at my disposal, including the inform handbook and my friends. The inform handbook was my number one source, because if what I was looking for wasn’t in there, it probably didn’t exist. 

Describe each of three puzzles in your game and how to solve each puzzle.
My three puzzles were combination puzzles, unusual use of objects, and information. Combination puzzle wasn’t too hard, the player had to figure out which items he/she found were able to be combined with the cauldron. This also ties in with the unusual items puzzle, where the player found peculiar items around the house and had to figure out what is used for what. Finally, there was an information puzzle, where there was a simple “scratched out” message where you only had to replace a couple letters to find out that a secret room was in the bedroom.

Discuss the gameplay mechanics in your game and how they improve the user's 
experience.
The gameplay mechanic that I like the most and improves the user’s experience is the combine mechanic. I thought it tied in really well with the Halloween theme, and made the player feel like they were making potions like a witch. I also thought it was just an overall good mechanic to add that gave the game character.
Discuss the beta testing process: Who tested your game? 
Nicole tested my game. She got through most of the puzzles and figured out a lot of the things on her own. I only nudged her along when she got some wording incorrectly with some of my made up commands, but other than that she was able to complete the game in full.
How did their feedback affect your game? 
I had a lot of interactions that I didn’t mean to happen in my game, along with some of the commands not working properly. This helped me to address these issues and I was able to bring everything together and make sure everything was working.
Whose game did you beta test? 
I beta tested Riley’s game.
What feedback were you able to give?
The biggest thing that I saw, was when you are supposed to talk to his NPC and ask him a certain question, its not obvious or hinted on what question you should ask him, let alone that specific one. Also, I recommended some description changes due to consistency.
What are you most proud of?
I’m most proud of my potions in whole. Along with the combining command, and being able to use them for certain things, I really enjoyed making them and implementing them. As I said before, I think it gives my game character and makes it stand out over the other games in terms of its uniqueness. 
What would you do differently next time?
Next time, I would probably have the NPC interact with the player more, give the player items and things like that. For this, the NPC is here to give the player hints and story.
