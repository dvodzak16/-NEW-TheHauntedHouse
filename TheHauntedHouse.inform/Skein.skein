Its Halloween, and you&apos;re out trick-or-treating with your parents. Its almost midnight, and you have arrived at this spooky-looking house. You look for your parents, but they seem to have run into a friend. You&apos;ll only take a second. You open the large iron gate and enter the front yard, and as you enter, the gate slams behind you! Trapped, your parents can&apos;t seem to hear you; you have to find a way out!

Upon entering, you can clearly see that this is the biggest room in the house. The house itself has a cliche haunted house look, but you aren&apos;t certain if its for show or for real...A chandelier hangs delicately from the ceiling, giving the room eerie light. There is a piano in the corner. There are two potted plants on either sides of the stairs. There are stairs to the north. The Family Room is to the west. The Library is to the east.
