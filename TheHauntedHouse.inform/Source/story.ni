"A Haunted Halloween" by Dylan Vodzak

When play begins: say "Its Halloween, and you're out trick-or-treating with your parents. Its almost midnight, and you have arrived at this spooky-looking house. You look for your parents, but they seem to have run into a friend. You'll only take a second. You open the large iron gate and enter the front yard, and as you enter, the gate slams behind you! Trapped, your parents can't seem to hear you; you have to find a way out!"

The Front Yard is a room. The description is "A large front yard surrounded by 10 foot tall hedges. An iron gate is locked behind you, leading towards the road.
