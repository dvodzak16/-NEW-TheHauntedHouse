Its Halloween, and you&apos;re out trick-or-treating with your parents. Its almost midnight, and you have arrived at this spooky-looking house. You look for your parents, but they seem to have run into a friend. You&apos;ll only take a second. You open the large iron gate and enter the front yard, and as you enter, the gate slams behind you! Trapped, your parents can&apos;t seem to hear you; you have to find a way out!

Front Yard
